Assignment-1
1. String Manipulation
Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a given string, ignoring case sensitivity. Use conditional statements to exclude special characters.
2. Anagram Checker
Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. Use arrays to count character occurrences and conditional operators for comparisons.
3. Array Rotation
Write a program to rotate an array n times to the right or left based on user input. Use conditional statements to handle boundary conditions.
4. Subarray Sum
Write a program to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a given array. Use conditional operators to update the maximum sum dynamically.
5. Matrix Multiplication
Write a program to multiply two matrices. Use conditional statements to validate if the matrices can be multiplied based on their dimensions.
6. Palindrome Checker
Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome. Use string manipulation and conditional statements to handle case sensitivity and ignore spaces.
7. Array Element Comparison
Write a program to compare elements of two arrays of the same size. Use conditional operators to print whether each pair of elements is equal, greater, or lesser.
8. Vowel and Consonant Counter
Write a program to count vowels and consonants in a given string. Use conditional statements and the switch operator for checking vowel/consonant conditions.
9. Frequency of Elements
Write a program to find the frequency of each element in an array. Use nested loops with conditional operators to count unique occurrences.
10. Valid Parentheses
Write a program to check if a given string containing only {}, [], and () is valid. Use conditional statements and stacks to verify that each opening bracket has a matching closing bracket in the correct order.
